# Welcome postgresql event organizator !

This documentation is here to answer to this problem :

*
I'm organizing an amazing conference and I'm going to use postgresql europe website for payment, registration, sponsors, etc. How do I do to create a website that is able to communicate with pgeu?

This is actually really simple ! There are a few things to know though and this documentation is there to help you. There are two parts in this website, the first one contains everything you need for the backend of your website and the second one is about the frontend.

Don't hesitate to take a look at how the other events did their website. For instance, there is a list of pgdays websites :

* [Nordic pgDay](http://2015.nordicpgday.org/) : **ADD GIT**
* [pgDay Paris](http://pgday.paris/) : [git](https://github.com/louiseGrandjonc/pgdayparis)
